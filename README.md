Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

How It Works
1. The program asks the user to input a number.
2. It uses the modulus operator (`%`) to determine the remainder when the number is divided by 2.
3. If the remainder is 0, the number is **even**; otherwise, itâ€™s **odd**.
4. The result is displayed to the user.

Steps to Run
1. Open a terminal or any Python IDE.
2. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved.
3. Run the program using:
```python task1.py```

Steps to Run
1. Open a terminal or any Python IDE.
